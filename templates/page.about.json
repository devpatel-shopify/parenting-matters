But despite being an \"expert\" who worked at Great Ormond Street, when I became a real-life father I couldn't stop my 3 day old son screaming his head off. I had to call the midwife, who soon sorted him out. Over time I became more and more interested in understanding how the ways that parents behave affects their children.<\/p><p>I was fortunate to be appointed head of the parenting clinic at the Maudsley Hospital, where for the last 25 years I and my team have worked with families. We’ve researched the most effective way to enable them help their children become happier and better adjusted, as well as learning faster and having improved brain growth. Every family and every child is different, but there are some universal truths about good parenting. My clinic is limited in how many families we can see, so I am delighted to bring the fruits of my research and personal experience to a far wider audience by going online.\"<\/p>",
